# Natural-Language-Processing End-to-End Implementation Examples

![nlp](./img/nlp.jpg)

In recent years, natural language processing (NLP) has seen quick growth in quality and usability, and this has helped to drive business adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. In the last few years, researchers have been applying newer deep learning methods to NLP. Data scientists started moving from traditional methods to state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep neural network (DNN) algorithms which use language models pretrained on large text corpora.

This repository contains the full implementation example of several Natural Language Processing methods in Python, which can be used in any dataset of indutry to readily usage. I tried to output it all as jupyter notebook so that it's easy to read and follow through. 

The goal of this repository is to build a comprehensive set of tools and examples that leverage recent advances in NLP algorithms

When properly consumed, this will guide you through the basics of Natural Langeuage Processing concepts and skills through several different libraries (Keras, Tenforfow), and eventually will help build production-level systems like Chatbot / Recommendation system based on the language data
